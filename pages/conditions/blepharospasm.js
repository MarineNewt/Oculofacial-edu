        <h2 id="Diagnosis" className={styles.secHeading}>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p className={styles.infoParagraph}>• Blepharospasm is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive, and uncontrollable contractions of the muscles around the eyelids. It can lead to excessive blinking, eye closure, or even forceful squeezing of the eyelids. Diagnosis of blepharospasm is typically based on clinical evaluation, including a thorough medical history and physical examination. In some cases, additional tests or imaging may be performed to rule out other underlying conditions.</p>
        <h2 id="Symptoms" className={styles.secHeading}>Symptoms</h2>
        <p className={styles.infoParagraph}>• Common symptoms of blepharospasm may include:<br></br>
          <b>Excessive Blinking:</b> Frequent and involuntary blinking, often occurring rapidly and repetitively.<br></br>
          <b>Eye Closure:</b> In more severe cases, blepharospasm can lead to involuntary and prolonged closure of both eyelids, causing functional blindness.<br></br>
          <b>Sensitivity to Light:</b> Increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) can exacerbate the symptoms.<br></br>
          <b>Dry Eyes:</b> Excessive blinking can result in dry eyes, which may cause discomfort or irritation.<br></br>
          <b>Irritation:</b> The condition can cause general irritation which significantly impact daily activities, including reading, driving, and social interactions.</p>
        <h2 id="Causes" className={styles.secHeading}>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
        <p className={styles.infoParagraph}>• The exact cause of blepharospasm is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurological factors. The first factor noted is there may be a genetic predisposition to the condition, as it can run in families. Blepharospasm is thought to involve dysfunction in the basal ganglia, a region of the brain responsible for controlling muscle movements. Despite the exact internal causes being unknown, stress, fatigue, and exposure to bright lights or wind may exacerbate the symptoms.</p>
        <h2 id="Treatments" className={styles.secHeading}>Treatment options</h2>
        <p className={styles.infoParagraph}>• While there is no cure for blepharospasm, several treatment options are available to manage the condition and improve quality of life. As a first step to managing symptoms you should work towards reducing triggers such as stress and bright lights, using artificial tears for dry eyes and wearing tinted glasses to reduce light sensitivity. When symptoms become unmanageable at home, the most common treatment, botulinum toxin, (<Link href="/treatments/botox">Botox</Link>) injections into the affected muscles can effectively reduce muscle contractions and alleviate symptoms. These injections typically provide relief for around 3 months before the effects begin to fade and repeat treatment is needed. Oral medications, such as anticholinergic drugs, may also be prescribed to help control muscle spasms and reduce symptoms. In severe cases that do not respond to other treatments, surgical procedures like myectomy (removal of some eyelid muscles) may be considered.<br></br><br></br> Blepharospasm is a chronic condition that can significantly impact an individual's life. It's essential to work closely with a neurologist or ophthalmologist to determine the most appropriate treatment plan, which may involve a combination of therapies to effectively manage the condition and improve your overall well-being.</p>
